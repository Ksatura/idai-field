## First steps

After starting the client for the first time, the project "test" will be active, allowing you to experiment
with the application's functionality using a set of test data. Please note that as long as the test project is
selected, any newly created data sets will be deleted and all changes will be reset when restarting the client. For
this reason, synchronization with other clients or databases is not performed for the test project.  

In order to work with the client productively, you should first follow these steps:

1. The menu **Settings**, which you can open via the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen, allows you
to change some basic settings applied to all projects. As a first step, please enter your editor name. This
name will be stored in the database along with every change you make. It is strongly recommended to set the
name, especially if data is going to be synchronized with other clients.  

2. In the menu **Settings** you can also change the path to the image directory. This may be necessary if you want to
access an image directory located on a network device (NAS) used by several users simultaneously. Please note that
in each case images must be imported via the client. Image files that are manually placed in the image directory
can **not** be used by the application. 

3. Click on the project name "test" in order to open the **Project management**. In this menu, you can create
a new project by clicking the plus button. Allowed characters for the project name are letters, numbers and hyphens.
As soon as the new project has been loaded, you can enter basic project metadata by clicking the edit button in the
project management menu.

To start entering data, switch to the area **Overview** where you can add new operations (trenches,
buildings, survey areas). Subsequently, you can add resources (e. g. stratigraphical units, finds or building parts)
inside these operations in the areas **Excavation**, **Building** and **Survey**. 

Use the menu **Create backup**, which is also accessible via the dropdown menu in the upper right screen corner, to
create backup files of your project data regularly.
